**Because every life matters — paws, hooves, feathers, tails, and tiny paws too.**

## 🐶 About WoofCare

**WoofCare** began as a small act of kindness — feeding street dogs. But today, it’s much more than that.

From hungry squirrels and injured birds to abandoned puppies and thirsty cows, **WoofCare stands for care without conditions**. We believe that every living being, no matter how small or voiceless, deserves love, food, and protection.

> Kindness shouldn't be limited by species. 💛

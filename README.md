**Caring for the Unseen, Feeding the Forgotten.**

## 🐶 About WoofCare

**WoofCare** is a community-driven initiative aimed at feeding and caring for **stray dogs and cats** — animals that are often overlooked in our busy streets. We don’t just feed them, we document their journey to inspire others to show kindness where it's needed most.

This project was born out of compassion for those who can't ask for help but desperately need it.
